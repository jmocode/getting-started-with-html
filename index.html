    <b><H1>Introduction To HTML</H1></b>
    <b>Coding</b>
    <p>Coding a computer means telling a computer what you want it to do by writing 
    text <em>in a way</em> that it can understand. 
    Also referred to as programming language.</p>
    <b>Basics Of The Web</b>
<p>The web is comprised of collections of HTML documents. A web page is a text document
written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret
and display them. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the format for the language of 
the many types of documents on the web. URLs (Uniform Resource Identifier) is the 
address for documents on the web. HTTP is (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) rules for 
transferring files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) 
on the web. Web Application is any computer program that runs in a web browser.</p>
<b>HTML Basic Lingo</b>
<p><ul type="square">
  <p></p><li><b>Tag</b> — An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags
    have an opening tag and a closing tag, some tags called <em>void</em> tags do not
    require a closing tag.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Element</b> — An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening
    and closing tags.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Attribute</b> — This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set
    the href attribute of an anchor tag you would write a href="www.url name.com" 
    contained inside of angled brackets.
  </li>
</ul></p>
<b>5 Steps To Thinking Like A Programmer:</b>
<p><ul type='square'>
  <li><b>Procedural Thinking</b> — Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear
  and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Abstract Thinking</b> — Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or 
    as programmers would say, <b>generality</b> amongst seemingly different things.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Systems Thinking</b> — Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem
    down into smaller pieces. Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper)
    for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making
    about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Technological Empathy</b> — "Technological Empathy" comes in many forms. For
    example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it
    works, and what it is good and bad at doing. A computer is a tool, as are the 
    programs we use and the programming languages used to write them. It's almost
    impossible to program anything substantial without a basic understanding of how
    these tools work.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Debugging</b> — Debugging is a systematic process of relentlessly identifying
    the cause of a computer program that doesn't work. When a program doesn't work, it's
    because there is a mistake (also known as a <em>bug</em>) somewhere in the 
    computer code. Since these mistakes are an unavoidable part of programming, every
    good programmer has a system for fixing them and it usually follows these steps:
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Collective evidence (what makes this program fail?)</li>
      <li>Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?)</li>
      <li>Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)</li>
      <li>Fix the problem.</li></p>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <b>HTML Examples</b>
  <p>The basic structure for HTML markup is <b>< name ><em> contents</em> < /name ></b> 
  this consists of an opening tag, the contents and a closing tag called an element.
  <br>
  <br>
  < b > tag — The b tag renders text <b>BOLD</b>
  <br>
    < em > tag — The em tag renders text <em>italic</em>
    <br>
    < br > tag — The break tag creates a line break
    <br>
    < p > tag — The paragraph tag creates a box around text
    <br>
    < a > tag — The anchor tag creates a <a href="www.udemy.com">link</a> to another web page
    
    <br>
    < img > tag — The image tag adds an image
    <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="Hipmunk!">
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Basic HTML Document Structure includes the following elements:<br><br> <b>!Doctype HTML</b><br> <b>html</b><br><b>head</b><br> <b>title</b><br><b>body</b></p>
    <br>
    <b>Computers Are Stupid</b>
    <p>Programmers often describe computers as <em>"stupid"</em> because computers 
      only understand the instructions that human programmers give to them. This makes
      them highly sensitive and open to small mistakes (that a human would not make) leading to huge problems.
  </p>
  <b>Forgetting is Fine</b>
  <p>There are just too many facts to remember. Don't sweat the small stuff,
  it's ok to forget as long as you understand how to get the details when you need
  them. Important points are also recapped at the end of each lesson. (Remember, Google is your friend!)</p>
